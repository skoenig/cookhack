## Zutaten
- 1/2 cup cacao powder
- 4 ounces 100% dark chocolate
- 1 Tablespoon coconut oil
- 1 cup avocado puree (about 2 large)
- 1 Tablespoon coconut flour
- 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon pink Himalayan salt

## Zubereitung
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Grease an 8x8 square baking pan.
3. Melt coconut oil and chocolate on stovetop,
stirring until melted.
4. Mix melted chocolate and avocado puree in a
large bowl using a hand blender.
5. Add all remaining ingredients, mixing well with
blender. I prefer my brownies a little lumpy, but
it’s the chef’s choice.
6. Add to prepared pan and bake for 35 - 45 minutes.
