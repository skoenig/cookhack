## Preparation
In a large pot (I use my cast iron Le Creuset), fry the onions in the oil. Turn the heat up, add the meat and brown on all sides. Now turn the heat down a bit and add the aromatics and the garlic. Stir in the tomato paste, ketjap manis and vinegar.

Cover with enough water to cover the meat and bring to the boil. Now simmer for 3 or 4 hours on a low heat. The sauce will have thickened considerably. Taste, and season with salt and pepper. Chop the cilantro leaves and strew over liberally just before serving.

In a dry frying pan toast the peanuts. They're done when the peanutty fumes hit your nose. Add the coconut and fry until golden. Remove from the pan and serve in little bowls.

Halve the cucumber lengthways. Gouge out the seeds using a teaspoon. Discard seeds. Now cut the cucumber into thin half moon slices. Place the slices in a bowl. Cut the chile in half, remove the seeds and chop very finely. Add to the cucumber. Now make a salad dressing by adding together the oil, vinegar, and a pinch each of sugar, salt and pepper in a bowl. Drizzle some of the salad dressing over the cucumber salad. Toss and serve.

I like to serve the Babi Ketjap with cooked white rice, sambal paste, cucumber salad and little bowls of the peanut & coconut mix.
